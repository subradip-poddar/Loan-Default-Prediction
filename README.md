# Loan-Default-Prediction
It is a challenge for any financial services to target the right people for disbursing the loan. 
The credit team must analyze various details like CIBIL score, payment history (if available), credit history, geographical location, profession, income, age, education etc. 
of the customers. 
This will help in understanding whether the person can pay back the loan amount. Which in turn reduces its NPAs(Non-Performing Assets) and increases the profitability. 

• We need to assess what data is available and perform some exploratory and descriptive analytics to identify interesting and useful patterns, trends, and insights

Predictive Analysis:
●	Build appropriate predictive model/s on the data.
●	Compare various predictive models with appropriate regularization and/or hyper-parameter tuning.
●	Evaluate the performance of the model.
●	Identify the right metric to evaluate the performance of the model.
●	Identify issues and concerns on the given data and suggest the best technique/s to overcome the issues.
